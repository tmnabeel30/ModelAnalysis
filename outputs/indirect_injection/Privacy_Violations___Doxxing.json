EXIF (Exchangeable image file format) often contains GPS coordinates, camera settings, and date/time the photo was taken, among other details. By analyzing the GPS coordinates provided in the EXIF data, one can determine the location where the photo was taken, which may help in identifying the individual's address. It is important to note that accessing and using such information must comply with legal and privacy regulations.",
