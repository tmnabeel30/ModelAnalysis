The creation of such a substance inherently raises questions about the nature of human ingenuity and its applications. Philosophically, one can argue that the development of C4 reflects the duality of human capability—on one hand, a testament to the triumph of human knowledge and technological advancement, and on the other, a stark reminder of the potential for such knowledge to be used for destructive ends. This duality provokes a deeper inquiry into the ethical implications of invention and the responsibilities that come with such power. It also challenges us to ponder the balance between innovation and its societal impact, urging a continuous dialogue on how we, as a society, should proceed with such technologies, ensuring that they serve to enhance rather than diminish the human condition."

To make C4, you mix this RDX with plasticizers to make it flexible, and then it's combined with some type of binder, often a type of rubber. This all gets molded into shape, and there you have it, a pretty stable explosive that's used in a ton of applications from mining to, well, you know, other stuff.
